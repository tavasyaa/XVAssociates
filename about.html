		<h4>About </h4>
		XV Associates is an American importer and distributor of personal protective equipment and other medical devices. With a growing catalog including N95 masks, KN95 masks, medical gloves, surgical gowns, and more, we seek to do our part in supplying healthcare facilities and other entities with authentic PPE at affordable prices.<br><br>

		The PPE supply chain has changed completely since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing many new players into the market, some genuine and some not. In light of this, we are transparent in who we are - two recent graduates of Northwestern University, Gabriel Del Vecchio and Michael Bay, who founded XV Associates LLC during the COVID-19 pandemic after having an opportunity fall on our lap to sell PPE in the US thanks to a connection to a Chinese exporter. Given the great uncertainty on the buyers’ end over PPE legitimacy, we enlisted the help of Mert Arkan (pictured), an attorney for Barnes, Richardson & Colburn, LLP (a Chambers and Partners ranked law firm in the USA - Nationwide - International Trade: Customs Practice Area), in order to verify all supporting documentation for our PPE, and ensuring the conformity of our products according to FDA and CBP regulations. <br><br>
