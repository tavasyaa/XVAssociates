A quick static website for a friend's PPE business, whipped this one up in a day.

To see what's up, clone this repo to your computer and double click the file index.html.

To do:    
Gitignore, I've been lazy    
PHP or js for the form   
Google Analytics    
Get rid of the extra js files, maybe css too    
Hosting decision    
Navbar on mobile
